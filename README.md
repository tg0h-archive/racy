# Racy

Racy is a command-line tool that manages your releases with Gitlab and Jira.

Finding Jira tickets, updating them, keeping track of ticket dependencies in Service Desk, Jira or Gitlab, and moving the the ticket along to done is a lot of work.

To get rid of this drudgery, I came up with Racy.

## Installation

### Node

Install racy globally.

```
npm install --global
```

## Usage

run `ra` to see what you can do with racy.

### Configuration

see the [configuration docs](docs/config.md)

## Cool features

- `ra status` displays a table that shows the jira ticket and its git commit status
